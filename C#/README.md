# 💻 C# Language Learning Modules

This section is dedicated to learning **C#**, a modern, object-oriented, imperative programming language. C# also supports **functional programming**, **concurrent programming**, and various other paradigms. 

The content is organized around **paradigms**, and inside those paradigms, we break down further topics for a deep dive into the language.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master the imperative paradigm with basic syntax and structure
- Dive into object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Explore functional programming features in C# such as LINQ, lambda expressions, and immutability
- Learn concurrent programming with threads, async/await, and tasks for better performance
- Learn to test your code effectively with unit testing and debugging tools in C#

## 📌 Requirements

- Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Code with C# extensions)
- .NET SDK installed (for compiling and running C# code)
- NUnit, xUnit, or MSTest for unit testing (optional but recommended)
