//1. Displays an alert with the message "Welcome and welcome to our website!" 
alert("Welcome and welcome to our website!");

//2. Declare a variable called name and assign it the value "Moon."

//3. Create a variable called age and assign it the value 25. 
let age = 25;
console.log(age);

//4. Set a variable SalesNumber and assign it the value 50. 
let salesNumber = 50;
console.log(salesNumber);

console.log(availableBalance);

//6. Displays an alert with the text "Error! Please complete all fields." 
alert("Error! Please complete all fields.");

//7. Declare a variable called errorMessage and assign it the value "Error! Complete all fields." 
//Now it shows an alert with the value of the errorMessage variable.
let errorMessage = "Error! Complete all fields.";
alert(errorMessage);

//8. Use a prompt to ask the user's name and store it in the name variable.
name = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log(name);

//9. Ask the user to enter her age using a prompt and store it in the age variable.
age = prompt("How old are you?");
console.log(age);

//10. Now, if the age is greater than or equal to 18, it shows an alert with the message
// "You can get your driver's license!"
if (age >= 18) {
    alert("You can get your driver's license!");
}
