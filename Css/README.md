CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the cornerstone of web styling. While it doesn't follow programming paradigms like imperative or object-oriented, it can be organized and scaled through architectural **methodologies** that bring structure and maintainability to complex projects.

This section is organized by **methodologies** and **conceptual categories** to help you explore the core and advanced techniques of writing modern, clean, and maintainable CSS.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and apply CSS architectural methodologies like BEM, OOCSS, and SMACSS
- Master core concepts such as specificity, inheritance, and the cascade
- Learn to create responsive layouts with media queries and modern layout techniques
- Enhance UI with CSS animations, transitions, and keyframes
- Embrace modern CSS features such as Flexbox, Grid, logical properties, and :has()
- Follow best practices for accessibility, performance, and scalability

## 🧰 Requirements

- A modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox)
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## 📝 Methodology Summary

| Methodology | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BEM         | A naming convention that promotes component-based structure and clarity using Block\_\_Element--Modifier |
| OOCSS       | Focuses on separating structure and skin, promoting reusability of objects and patterns                  |
| SMACSS      | A scalable methodology that breaks CSS into categories like base, layout, module, state, and theme       |
