# Tkinter GUI Learning

This directory is dedicated to learning and practicing GUI application development in Python using **Tkinter**, the standard GUI toolkit included with Python. It contains structured examples, categorized exercises, and mini-projects designed to gradually build proficiency in creating desktop interfaces.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the basics of Tkinter and how to build simple windows.
- Explore and master common and advanced widgets.
- Learn to handle user events and organize interface layouts.
- Practice reusable GUI utilities and styling with themes.
- Create functional mini-projects to apply concepts in real-world contexts.
