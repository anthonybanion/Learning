# 🐍 Python Language Learning Modules

Python is a powerful, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming styles, making it an ideal language for both beginners and professionals.

This directory is structured to explore **each paradigm separately**, highlighting core features, best practices, and idiomatic Python.
