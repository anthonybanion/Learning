# 🐍 Complete Easy Code Course 2025

Welcome to this repository, where I document my complete journey through the **Python Programming Course (2025 Edition)**.  
This course starts from the very basics—like installing Python—and progresses through variables, collections, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP).  
Each section includes **theory**, **hands-on coding**, and **labs** to practice and reinforce what’s been learned.

---

## 🎯 Course Objective

- Learn Python fundamentals from scratch.
- Explore variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries), and strings.
- Understand functions deeply, including \*args, \*\*kwargs, lambda functions, decorators, and closures.
- Master object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, methods, and properties.
- Practice with structured labs to apply knowledge from each module.

---

## 🧠 Target Audience

This course is designed for:

- 💻 Beginners with programming knowledge who want to learn Python.
- 🧪 Intermediate Python users who want to refresh their skills and learn about recent features in the latest versions of Python.

---

## 🧱 Course Structure

Each class is documented as a GitHub **Issue** containing:

- 📌 Topics and theory learned.
- 🔍 Code examples and snippets.
- ⚠️ Bugs encountered (if any).
- 🛠 Solutions or workarounds.
- 📓 Reflections and personal notes.
