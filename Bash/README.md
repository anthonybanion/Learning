# 🐚 Bash Learning Modules  

This section contains categorized resources, scripts, and examples to learn and practice **Bash scripting and command-line usage** in Unix/Linux environments.

Bash is not organized around formal programming paradigms like OOP or Functional Programming. Instead, this folder is structured based on **practical concepts**, **shell capabilities**, and **system administration techniques**.
