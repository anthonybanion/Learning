# 🎨 Assets (Shared Resources)

The `Assets/` directory contains **shared multimedia resources** used across multiple languages, projects, and examples in this repository.

These assets help support learning by providing visuals, sounds, and reusable materials that enhance the development experience or enrich code demonstrations.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
Assets/
├── images/         # PNG, JPG, SVG icons, diagrams, logos, and illustrative images
├── music/          # Soundtracks, background music, or sound effects
├── videos/         # Tutorial clips, animations, or recorded demos
├── fonts/          # Open-source typography for UI design or rendering text
└── others/         # Any shared asset that doesn't fit the categories above
```
## ✅ Usage Guidelines

- Use assets only if they are open-source or properly licensed for personal/educational use.
- Prefer compressed and optimized formats (.webp, .svg, .mp3, etc.) when possible.
- Keep asset names clear and descriptive, e.g., diagram-oop-vs-fp.svg.
- Don't duplicate resources — if you need something, check here first before creating a copy elsewhere.
