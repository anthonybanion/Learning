# 🐘 CRUD with Pascal & SQLite

Welcome to the **Pascal CRUD Project**! This repository demonstrates how to build a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using the **Pascal programming language** and **SQLite** as the database engine.

The project is designed to be a learning resource and includes two versions:

- 🧠 **Procedural Programming**: A step-by-step, structured approach.
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A modular, scalable version for maintainable software.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how to connect Pascal programs to an SQLite database.
- Learn how to perform **CRUD operations** using both **procedural** and **object-oriented** paradigms.
- Build a simple yet functional database-driven application.
- Practice clean code and modular design in Pascal.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a console-based CRUD application.
- Ideal for those learning database programming with Pascal.
- The project will be expanded to support more entities and GUI options in the future.
