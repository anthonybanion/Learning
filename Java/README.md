# ☕ Java Language Learning Modules

Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language known for its **platform independence**, **rich API**, and extensive use in **enterprise**, **mobile**, and **desktop** development.

This section is structured by **programming paradigms**, **core concepts**, and **standard libraries**, allowing you to explore Java in-depth.
