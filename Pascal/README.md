# 🟦 Pascal Language Learning Modules

Pascal is a structured, statically typed, imperative programming language designed for teaching good programming practices and data structures. It's widely used in academic settings and is known for its clarity and strong typing.

This directory is structured by **programming paradigms**, **core language constructs**, and **standard features** of Pascal.
